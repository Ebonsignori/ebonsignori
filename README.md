👋 I'm Evan. I live in Portland OR near Forest Park where I walk or run daily with my dog Syl. 

I don't drink caffeine, eat added sugar, drink alcohol, do drugs, travel frequently, or have fun! (Really though, I have more fun now than when I still did all of these things.)

In my dream world, I play piano for a living and code on the side for fun, but the dictates of reality have me doing the opposite. 

I'm on track to release solo piano originals in 2026. Below is the coding I do for fun.

## Obsidian plugins

- [obsidian-at-symbol-linking](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking) Adds the ability to generate markdown links to other documents using symbols like `@`.
- [obsidian-auto-journal](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal) Automatically creates daily or monthly journal pages following an opinionated file structure.
- [obsidian-timeline-schedule](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-timeline-schedule) Generates inline timelines from human-readable strings. e.g. 'Walk dog (30m)' would show up 30 minutes past a specified start time.  

## GH CLI extensions

- [gh-search-docs](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/gh-search-docs) Search GitHub Docs articles from your terminal.
- [gh-ask-docs](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/gh-ask-docs) Ask the GitHub Docs LLM (RAG app) questions about GitHub from your terminal.

## Websites & apps

### [Income Tax Calculator](https://ebonsignori.github.io/income-tax-calculator/)

**Repo**: [Income Tax Calculator](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/income-tax-calculator)
 
Like [Smart Asset's calculators](https://smartasset.com/taxes/oregon-tax-calculator), but it includes city-specific taxes for Portland OR, like [PFA, SHS, and the Art Tax](https://www.portland.gov/revenue/personal-tax).

You're welcome to open a PR to add city specific taxes for a city other than Portland OR. I prefer using this site instead of a spreadsheet for budget planning. 

### [evan.bio](https://evan.bio)
 
 **Repo**: [my-sites](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/my-sites) Source code for each of the static sites that live under https://evan.bio, my personal website.

### [resume.evan.bio](https://resume.evan.bio/)

Private repo, using [React-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/) to generate a resume. The resume is likely out of date by the time you're reading this. If you're a recruiter and you've read this far, congrats. You're welcome to the contact info within, you've earned it. 

### [ear.tools](https://ear.tools/)

Private repo. Before the era of LLMs, I attempted to make a web app for relative pitch training (playing music "by ear"). It's functional, but highly unpolished. I put it down when I discovered [Chet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chet-ear-training/id1405525467) for IOS since it met my training needs. 

## Other projects

- [water-plant-uml](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/water-plant-uml?tab=readme-ov-file) CLI tool for live-reloading and/or exporting PlantUML diagrams.
- [tts-book-to-audio](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/tts-book-to-audio) A clunky set of tools for putting together an audiobook from text using AI TTS models. Each character in a novel can be given a different voice.
- [stormlight-coppermind-summaries](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/stormlight-coppermind-summaries) Similar to the above, a set of audiobooks generated from the [Wiki summaries](https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive/Summary) for The Stormlight Archives series by Brandon Sanderson. 
- [myconfig](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/myconfig) My dotfiles. The repo had more activity when I was exclusively using Vim. I've caved. VSCode is good enough and I don't spend hours each month configuring it 🪦
